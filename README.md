It'll Get Easier, but you have to do it everyday, Thats the hard part...
Core Backend Concepts You Should Code

Beginner → Intermediate
1 → 4 → 5 → 2

Intermediate
6 → 7 → 3

Advanced / Real Backend Thinking
8 → 9 → 10

1. Rate Limiting
(protect APIs, abuse control, fairness)

2. Authentication & Authorization
(who are you vs what are you allowed to do)

3. Idempotency
(safe retries, duplicate prevention)

4. Request Validation & Schema Enforcement
(trust nothing from the client)

5. Pagination & Filtering
(scalability, performance, UX correctness)

6. Caching (Read & Write Strategies)
(speed vs consistency tradeoffs)

7. Background Jobs & Async Processing
(non-blocking work, eventual consistency)

8. Database Transactions & Consistency
(atomicity, partial failure handling)

9. Concurrency & Race Condition Handling
(two users, same resource, same time)

10. Observability (Logging, Metrics, Errors)
(debugging production, not localhost)
